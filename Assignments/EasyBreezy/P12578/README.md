The national flag of Bangladesh is bottle green in color and rectangular in size with the length (L) to
width ratio of 10:6. It bears a red circle on the background of green. It maintains the length (L) to
radius ratio of 5:1 (If the length is 10 then width should be 6 and radius should be 2). The color
in the background represents the greenery of Bangladesh while the red circle symbolizes the rising sun
and the sacrifice of lives in our freedom fight.

**For each test case output is a line with two space separated real numbers containing exactly two digits
after decimal point. Two numbers represent the area of red and green portion respectively.**
