# [UVa 12250](https://github.com/asaiahL9/4883-PT-Logan/blob/main/Assignments/P12250/12250.pdf) - Language Detection

English, Spanish, German, French, Italian and Russian are the 6 most prominent languages in the countries of European Union. Figure on the left shows
intensity of English speaking people in different European countries. All of these languages have different
words to represent the English word “HELLO”. For
example in Spanish the word equivalent to “HELLO”
is “HOLA”. In German, French, Italian and Russian language the word that means (or similar to)
“HELLO” is “HALLO”, “BONJOUR”, “CIAO” and
“ZDRAVSTVUJTE” respectively. In this problem
your task is pretty simple. You will be given one of
the six words mentioned above or any other word and
you will have to try and detect the language it is from.

**For each line of input except the last one produce one line of output. This line contains the serial of
output followed by a language name. If the input string is ‘HELLO’ or ‘HOLA’ or ‘HALLO’ or ‘BONJOUR’
or ‘CIAO’ or ‘ZDRAVSTVUJTE’ then you should report the language it belongs to. If the input string is
something other than these 6 strings print the string ‘UNKNOWN’ (without the quotes) instead. All characters in the output strings are uppercase as well. Look at the output for sample input for formatting
details
