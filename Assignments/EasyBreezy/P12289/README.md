# [UVa 12289](https://github.com/asaiahL9/4883-PT-Logan/blob/main/Assignments/EasyBreezy/P12289/12289.pdf) - One-Two-Three

Your little brother has just learnt to write one, two and three, in English. He has written a lot of those
words in a paper, your task is to recognize them. Note that your little brother is only a child, so he
may make small mistakes: for each word, there might be at most one wrong letter. The word length is
always correct. It is guaranteed that each letter he wrote is in lower-case, and each word he wrote has
a unique interpretation.

**For each test case, print the numerical value of the word.**

```
Sample Input:

3
owe
too
theee

Sample Output:

1
2
3
```
