# [UVa 10783](https://github.com/asaiahL9/4883-PT-Logan/blob/main/Assignments/P10783/10783.pdf) - Odd Sum

**Given a range [a, b], you are to find the summation of all the odd integers in this range. For example,
the summation of all the odd integers in the range [3, 9] is 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 24.
Input
There can be at multiple test cases. The first line of input gives you the number of test cases, T
(1 ≤ T ≤ 100). Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of 2 integers a and b (0 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 100)
in two separate lines.
Output
For each test case you are to print one line of output – the serial number of the test case followed by
the summation of the odd integers in the range [a, b].

Sample Input:

2
1
5
3
5

Sample Output:

Case 1: 9
Case 2: 8
```
