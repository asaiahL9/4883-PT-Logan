# [UVa 10931](https://github.com/asaiahL9/4883-PT-Logan/blob/main/Assignments/P10931/10931.pdf) - Parity

**We define the parity of an integer n as the sum of the bits in binary representation computed modulo
two. As an example, the number 21 = 101012 has three 1s in its binary representation so it has parity
3(mod2), or 1.
In this problem you have to calculate the parity of an integer 1 ≤ I ≤ 2147483647.
Input
Each line of the input has an integer I and the end of the input is indicated by a line where I = 0 that
should not be processed.
Output
For each integer I in the inputt you should print a line ‘The parity of B is P (mod 2).’, where B
is the binary representation of I.

**

```
Sample Input:

1
2
10
21
0

Sample Output:

The parity of 1 is 1 (mod 2).
The parity of 10 is 1 (mod 2).
The parity of 1010 is 2 (mod 2).
The parity of 10101 is 3 (mod 2).
